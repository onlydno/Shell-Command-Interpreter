# 🖥️ Shell Command Interpreter – C Project

This is a completed C-based shell interpreter project developed as part of my Operating Systems course (CS221). The shell mimics basic UNIX shell functionality, supporting user input commands, piping, I/O redirection, and background execution.

---

## ✅ What It Does

- Accepts and executes user commands
- Supports built-in and external commands
- Allows piping between commands (`|`)
- Supports input/output redirection (`<`, `>`)
- Enables background execution using `&`

---

## ⚙️ Built With

- C Programming Language
- Compiled with GCC
- Developed using Cygwin Terminal

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to apply the following concepts from the Operating Systems course:

- Process management and creation
- Command parsing
- I/O redirection and pipes
- Background processes in Linux
